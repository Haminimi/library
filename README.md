# Library ðŸ“–
## Description
This Library project is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)'s [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library). The Odin Project provides a high quality web development education maintained by an open source community.
## Live Demo
The [Library app](https://haminimi.github.io/library/) built by [me](https://github.com/Haminimi).
## Main Features
- **Switch Read Status:** The switch button enables the changing of a book's read status and provides an engaging and responsive effect.
- **Favorite Books and Favorite Button:** An user is able to add books to the list of favorite books by using the favorite button on a book card or by adding a book to the favorites while adding a new book through the modal.
- **Delete and Clear:** The delete button removes a book card from the display and, if the book was on the list of favorite books, it is also removed from the favorites. The clear button removes all existing cards from the display and, if they are on the list of favorite books, they are also removed from the favorites.
- **Prevent Duplicate Books:** The app doesn't allow the creation of duplicates, but if e.g. two books have the same titles but different authors, that isn't considered a duplicate and therefore the creation of two such books is possible without any restrictions.
- **Modern and Aesthetic Design:** The library boasts a sleek and minimalist user interface, characterized by clean lines and a clutter-free design.
- **Responsive Design:** The app provides consistent user experience across various screen sizes.

**To Do:**
- **Storage:** Later in the course this feature will be implemented.
- **Easily Close Modal:** This feature is inspired by [Web Dev Simplified's solution](https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2023-04/html-dialog/). It's implementation allows for closing a modal when a user clicks outside of it. I did implement this feature and it worked completely fine in the WebKit browsers, but there was the issue with closing a modal when a user clicks on the select element in Firefox. At the moment this chunk of code is commented out.
- **Dark Mode**
- **Keyboard Support**
## Tech
**The project is built with:**
- HTML
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Vanilla CSS
## Reflection
The code could probably be more optimized, and I intend to work on it in the future. In particular, the main displayBook function appears a bit messy at the moment. Nevertheless, I am currently satisfied with the overall look of the code and the project's outcome. I am excited to see the new [selectmenu](https://open-ui.org/) element in action and to see some other changes that will give us more control over the appearance of certain web elements, especially forms and related components.
